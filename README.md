# python_vscode_setup
This repo contains basic setup for python vscode project - some settings and extensions recommendations.

# setup
create a virtual environment in .venv in main directory

for now it expects the tests to be in application/tests but you can adjust that if you wish in .vscode/settings.json

# remarks
pylint will probably highlight a lot of things in the code, just fyi. You can switch it to flake8, I think it's more forgiving

you can also switch black-formatter to autopep8 - it is meant to be more configurable
